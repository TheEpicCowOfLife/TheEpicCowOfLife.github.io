Hm, getting this to work locally was oddly complicated (and by that I still don't know exactly what ruby package management madness goes on behind the scenes).
I'm just going to push this to github and see if it still deploys. Wish me luck.

Edit: It worked!!!!!

Equations... please work 

$$u\frac{1}{w}u$$

Did it work? What about inline $$ x^{x_x}$$ stuff
