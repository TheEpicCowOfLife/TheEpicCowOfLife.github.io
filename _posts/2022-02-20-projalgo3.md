In this article, we will talk about *Sudoku*, and why it is possibly one of the greatest denial of service attacks on the human intelligence! I'll show how this problem can be formulated as a feasibility problem, and my various findings on how the algorithms performs. 

If you haven't read the [first part]({% post_url 2022-02-05-projalgo %}), do it now, otherwise things will simply not make sense.

If you haven't read the [second part]({% post_url 2022-02-15-projalgo2 %}), you should do it too because it helps put everything into context.

# Sudoku
You probably already know what sudoku is, but for avoidance of doubt, here is the problem:

You are given a 9x9 grid with some numbers filled in already. Fill in the rest of the grid such that:
- Every row forms a permutation of integers 1-9
- Every column forms a permutation of integers 1-9
- Each of the 3x3 boxes indicated by thickened borders contains a permutation of integers 1-9.

Note that a puzzle is defined by a set of filled in numbers (clues), such that there is a **a single unique solution**. Clearly, there are very many puzzles that exist.

Below is an image of a sudoku puzzle, and its **unique solution**.

In contrast to N-M queens where there can be many valid solutions, here any solution found is **unique**. This means that convergence of any algorithm, at all, will be quite miraculous.

# In search of data
Since there are very many sudoku puzzles (a puzzle consists the starting set of clues), we can just do the obvious thing and run the algorithm on each puzzle and see if it solves it or not! 

But where do we get data? By entering the rabbit hole.

Google was very kind to me, and I immediately found this [repository](https://github.com/t-dillon/tdoku). This is an extremly optimised sudoku solver, as if it was written by someone whose sole purpose in life was the write the sudoku solver to end all sudoku solvers, and end the years of man-hours spent writing sudoku solvers.

Well, it really isn't that dramatic, but that's what I imagined as I waded through man-years of efforts dedicated solely to the study of sudoku- scrolling down the gargantuan algorithm [writeup](https://t-dillon.github.io/tdoku/#NerdSniped:ASudokuStory), infinitely recursing in more and more references like some kind of horrid academic hydra. Then there was the meticulous benchmarking of a dozen top algorithms written by a dozen authors, each presumably with their own set of unique insights and observations.

Looking into the data sources, the hydra splits yet again. Not only are people solving sudokus, automating the solving of sudokus, there are people dedicating their intellect to generating puzzles? [Here is a forum spanning 61 pages](https://web.archive.org/web/20211117190314/forum.enjoysudoku.com/the-hardest-sudokus-new-thread-t6539.html). Participants communicate in brief, but vague posts with code-words like "sk-loop" and "bi bi pattern", but somehow perfectly understand each others' dizzyingly abstract ideas: a sign of terrifying collective intelligence. They are not putting their minds to curing cancer. This is a community dedicated to writing programs to generate sudoku puzzles, with the aim for finding the hardest puzzles for computers and humans to solve.

If a denial of service attack can naturally self-replicate, does that mean that it is a virus? Is sudoku a virus? 

Either way, should I be so cynical as I myself, was prepared to justify throwing my man-weeks into this black hole of intellect?

I gladly took the `data.zip` file and left.
