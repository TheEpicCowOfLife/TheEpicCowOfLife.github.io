In this article, we will talk about *Sudoku*, and why it is possibly one of the greatest denial of service attacks on the human intelligence! I'll show how this problem can be formulated as a feasibility problem, and my various findings on how the algorithms performs. 

If you haven't read the [first part]({% post_url 2022-02-05-projalgo %}), do it now, otherwise things will simply not make sense.

If you haven't read the [second part]({% post_url 2022-02-15-projalgo2 %}), you should do it too because it helps put everything into context.

# Sudoku
You probably already know what sudoku is, but for avoidance of doubt, here is the problem:

You are given a 9x9 grid with some numbers filled in already. Fill in the rest of the grid such that:
- Every row forms a permutation of integers 1-9
- Every column forms a permutation of integers 1-9
- Each of the 3x3 boxes indicated by thickened borders contains a permutation of integers 1-9.

Note that a puzzle is defined by a set of filled in numbers (clues), such that there is a **a single unique solution**. Clearly, there are very many puzzles that exist.

Below is an image of a sudoku puzzle, and its **unique solution**.

In contrast to N-M queens where there can be many valid solutions, here any solution found is **unique**. This means that convergence of any algorithm, at all, will be quite miraculous!

# In search of data
Since there are very many sudoku puzzles (a puzzle consists the starting set of clues), we can just do the obvious thing and run the algorithm on each puzzle and see if it solves it or not! 

But where do we get data? By entering the rabbit hole.

Google was very kind to me, and I immediately found this [repository](https://github.com/t-dillon/tdoku). This is an extremly optimised sudoku solver, as if it was written by someone whose sole purpose in life was the write the sudoku solver to end all sudoku solvers, and end the years of man-hours spent writing sudoku solvers.

Well, it really isn't that dramatic, but that's what I imagined as I waded through man-years of efforts dedicated solely to the study of sudoku- scrolling down the gargantuan algorithm [writeup](https://t-dillon.github.io/tdoku/#NerdSniped:ASudokuStory), infinitely recursing in more and more references like some kind of horrid academic hydra. Then there was the meticulous benchmarking of a dozen top algorithms written by a dozen authors, each presumably with their own set of unique insights and observations.

Looking into the data sources, the hydra splits yet again. Not only are people solving sudokus, automating the solving of sudokus, there are people dedicating their intellect to generating puzzles? [Here is a forum spanning 61 pages](https://web.archive.org/web/20211117190314/forum.enjoysudoku.com/the-hardest-sudokus-new-thread-t6539.html). Participants communicate in brief, but vague posts with code-words like "sk-loop" and "bi bi pattern", but somehow perfectly understand each others' dizzyingly abstract ideas: a sign of terrifying collective intelligence. They are not putting their minds to curing cancer. This is a community dedicated to writing programs to generate sudoku puzzles, with the aim for finding the hardest puzzles for computers and humans to solve.

If a denial of service attack can naturally self-replicate, does that mean that it is a virus? Is sudoku a virus? 

Either way, should I be so cynical as I myself, was prepared to justify throwing my man-weeks into this black hole of intellect?

I finally took the `data.zip` file and left.

## Inside data.zip
There were 9 data sets. I unzipped it and committed to my repository.

Foolish Quang.

There was a dataset over 100 mb when unzipped, and now I couldn't push to github. Great. There goes an afternoon expanding my git vocabulary to try and undo some commits. If you ever run into the same situation, `git reset -soft` (or something like that) will undo a commit without changing the files in your repository.

After ignoring the datasets with multiple solutions or no solutions, there were 4 major data sets I considered.

- [puzzles0_kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku): 100000 puzzles, sourced from a kaggle challenge.
- [puzzles2_17_clue](http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00013890/sudokumin.php): 49000 17-clue puzzles generated by a professor from the University of Western Australia
- [puzzles3_magictour_top1465](http://magictour.free.fr/sudoku.htm): Magictour (a mysterious online user) listed their hardest 1465 puzzles.
- [puzzles6_forum_hardest_1106](https://web.archive.org/web/20211117190314/forum.enjoysudoku.com/the-hardest-sudokus-new-thread-t6539.html): The product of the aforementioned forum of people dedicating their intelligence to generating the most dastardly puzzles. These are the 375 top puzzles.

According to the tdoku repository where I sourced this data, these datasets are roughly in order of difficulty. 

## A Puzzle's difficulty.

But what does difficulty really mean? Good thing reading those forums answered this question before I decided to have a crack at some of the sudokus in the dataset. Turns out people have created [sudoku solvers](https://github.com/SudokuMonster/SukakuExplainer) **that solve sudokus using human-like deduction**. Each *technique* aims to make progress by ruling out possible entries from cells. They seem to work by trying to make progress by going down an increasingly esoteric list of techniques, and rate the difficulty of the puzzle by the most esoteric technique used.

What exactly are the "techniques"?

Let's look through the dataset...

### puzzles0_kaggle
I put a couple kaggle puzzles of the dataset through and all the "puzzles" look fairly trivial: they just consist of applying the basic sudoku rules over and over like in the picture below
![Image of a a simple deduction](/assets/projalgos/dataset0.png)

This is consistent with what the comments on the Kaggle post says

### puzzles2_17_clue
It is well known that 17 is the minimum number of clues required for a puzzle to have a unique solution. While it may be intuitive that the less clues you give, the harder the puzzle must be, that is actually not really the case. There are some very simple 17 clue puzzles in there, that can be solved by a beginner using simple techniques like above. 

However puzzles requiring more advanced deductions are quite common in the dataset. To illustrate, here's one such technique:

![Image of a slightly smarter deduction](/assets/projalgos//dataset2.png)

Many more esoteric technique features in the database, but an experienced human solver could reasonably do most of these.

### puzzles3_magictour_top1465
Here's where things start getting unhinged. It is at this point that people are generating sudoku puzzles with the intent of making them as difficult to solve as possible.

Here's one example of a deduction required to solve the first puzzle in the dataset.

![Image of a fairly unhinged deduction](/assets/projalgos/dataset3.png)

To give you an idea of what is going on in this madness, I've pasted the entire deduction below. Happy scrolling.

<div id = "dataset3_explainer" class = "hidden" markdown="1">
{% highlight plaintext %} 
    {% include projalgos/puzzles3_explanation.txt %}
{% endhighlight %}

</div>

In short, these puzzles require brute force to solve. No human would have the patience to solve them.


## puzzles6_forum_hardest_1106
A quick mention of the puzzles4 and puzzles5 dataset, they have largely the same backstory of puzzles6: collections of the hardest sudoku puzzles generated by the forum. However these sets contained more puzzles, and the difficulty was more "dilute". However they were still crazy hard, and were strictly harder than even the puzzles in the previous dataset.

We skip ahead to puzzles6, a collection of the hardest puzzles amongst the hardest puzzles. Plugging them into sukaku explainer, we are greeted with a particularly forboding message.

![Window saying "The next solving techniques are advanced ones that may take a very long computing time. Do you want to continue anyway?:](/assets/projalgos/sukaku_explainer_boss_music.png)

This happens a couple of times, and each time out pops a very cooked deduction chain. Here is an impressively cooked deduction.
