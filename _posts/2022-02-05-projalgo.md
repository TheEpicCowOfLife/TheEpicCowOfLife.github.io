# What is this post about?
I've been doing a thing ***"mathematical research"***. There are these really weird algorithms that try to solve certain types of problems using **projections**. However for some reason they seem to be able to solve combinatorial problems, and nobody has been able to give good mathematical justification for why they work. Hence I have spent the summer poking around these algorithms, and this blog post collates all my observations.


### Why was I doing this?
This summer I had the luxury of participating in the [University of Melbourne's Mathematics and Statistics
Vacation Scholarships Program](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/vacation-scholarships). Over the course of 4 weeks, I undertook this project with my supervisor [Matthew Tam](https://matthewktam.github.io/index.html).

# Mathematical preliminaries

## Feasibility problems
We will be looking at a very specific type of problem. Suppose we had an Euclidean space $$E$$ (loosely speaking, it's another name for $$\reals^n$$), and $$n$$ constraint sets $$C_1, C_2, \dots, C_n \subseteq E$$. A feasibility problem asks to find an $$x \in E$$ such that

$$x \in C_1 \cap C_2 \cap \dots \cap C_n$$

or to determine that  $$ C_1 \cap C_2 \cap \dots \cap C_n = \varnothing$$

A set is $$S$$ **convex** if $$x,y \in S$$, then $$\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in S$$ for all $$\lambda \in (0,1)$$. That is, the line connecting $$x$$ and $$y$$ are also in $$S$$.

A convex feasibility problem is a feasibility problem where all the constraint sets are convex.

# Projection
Given a set $$S$$, define the (possibly set valued) projection operator $$P_S$$ as 

$$P_S(x) = \{c \mid \lVert c - x \rVert \text{ is minimal for } c \in S\}$$

In other words, $$P_S(x)$$ projects $$x$$ to the set of closest points in $$S$$.

Now define the reflection operator $$R_S$$ as

$$ R_S(x) = 2P_S(x) - x$$

Essentially, $$R_S(x)$$ "reflects" $$x$$ into the set $$S$$, for visual intuition, see this illustration by Matthew Tam.

## Example projection
While projecting on a set sounds like an even harder problem to solve than finding the intersection of sets, there are very many sets for which projection is known and easily calculated, like hyperplanes and hyperspheres. However, even for sets with a combinatorial flavour, projection can be surprisngly easy to compute.

### Projecting onto the set of permutations
Consider the set $$S \subseteq \reals^n$$ where $$c = (c_1, \dots, c_n) \in S$$ iff $$(c_1, \dots, c_n)$$ is a permutation of the integers 1 to $$N$$.

### Claim
$$P_S(x) = (b_1,\dots, b_n)$$ where $$b_i$$ is the new index of $$x_i$$ after sorting $$(x_1, \dots, x_n)$$ in ascending order. 

### Proof
We wish to find the $$c \in S$$ that minimises $$\lVert x - c \rVert$$, or equivalently we can minimise $$\lVert x - c \rVert^2$$. Expanding, we get

$$\lVert x - c \rVert^2 = \lVert x \rVert^2 - 2 x \cdot c + \lVert c \rVert^2$$

Observe that since $$c$$ is a permutation, all $$c \in S$$ have the same magnitude. Hence we wish to maximise $$ x \cdot c$$

Now we use the rearrangement inequality- which tells us to maximise the value of $$x \cdot c$$, we need to arrange the values of $$c$$ so that the smallest value of $$c$$ matches the smallest value of $$x$$, the second smallest of $$c$$ with second smallest of $$x$$, and so on.

### Implication
$$P_S(x)$$ can be calculated in $$O(nlogn)$$ time. Wow.

In fact, many combinatorial sets tend to have the same idea of sorting, utilising a similar rearrangement inequality argument.

# Douglas Rachford Algorithm
This algorithm solves feasibility problems with 2 constraint sets, $$A,B \subseteq E$$

First, initialise $$x_0$$ to some arbitrary point in $E$. Then calculate the sequence using the following iteration step:

$$x_{k+1} = \frac{x_k + R_B R_A x_k}{2}$$

It is known that when $$A$$ and $$B$$ are **convex** and $$A \cap B \neq \varnothing$$, then $$x_k$$ will converge to a value $$x \in A \cap B$$, no matter the starting point $$x_0$$

## Product space formulation
In order to run this algorithm to $$n$$ sets $$C_1, \dots, C_n$$, define new constraint sets $$\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D} \subseteq E^n$$

$$\mathbf{C} = C_1 \times \dots \times C_n \text{ and } \mathbf{D} = \{(x,x,\dots,x) \mid x \in E\}$$

Clearly, if $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{C} \cap \mathbf{D}$$, then $$\mathbf{x}$$ will consist of $$N$$ identical copies of an $$x \in E$$, and will satisfy $$x \in C_i$$ for all $$i$$.

Also, we shall notate $$\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2,\dots, x_r)$$

Note that projections onto $$\mathbf{C}$$ and $$\mathbf{D}$$ can be quite easily calculated, we have

$$P_{\mathbf{C}}(\mathbf{x}) = P_{C_1}(x_1) \times \dots \times P_{C_n}(x_n)$$

$$P_{\mathbf{D}}(\mathbf{x}) = (\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \dots, \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)$$
