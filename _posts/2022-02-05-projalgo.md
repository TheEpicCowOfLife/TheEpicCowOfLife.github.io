# What is this post about?
I've been doing a thing called ***"mathematical research"***. There are these really weird algorithms that try to solve certain types of problems using **projections**. However for some reason they seem to be able to solve combinatorial problems, and nobody has been able to give good mathematical justification for why they work. Hence I have spent the summer poking around these algorithms, and this blog post collates all my observations.

$$\def\reals{\mathbb{R}}$$

### Why was I doing this?
This summer I had the luxury of participating in the [University of Melbourne's Mathematics and Statistics
Vacation Scholarships Program](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/vacation-scholarships). Over the course of 4 weeks, I undertook this project with my supervisor [Matthew Tam](https://matthewktam.github.io/index.html).

# Mathematical preliminaries
## Feasibility problems
We will be looking at a very specific type of problem. Suppose we had an Euclidean space $$E$$ (loosely speaking, it's another name for $$\reals^n$$), and $$n$$ constraint sets $$C_1, C_2, \dots, C_n \subseteq E$$. A feasibility problem asks to find an $$x \in E$$ such that

$$x \in C_1 \cap C_2 \cap \dots \cap C_n$$

or to determine that  $$ C_1 \cap C_2 \cap \dots \cap C_n = \varnothing$$

A set is $$S$$ **convex** if $$x,y \in S$$, then $$\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in S$$ for all $$\lambda \in (0,1)$$. That is, the line connecting $$x$$ and $$y$$ are also in $$S$$.

A convex feasibility problem is a feasibility problem where all the constraint sets are convex.

# Projection
Given a set $$S$$, define the (possibly set valued) projection operator $$P_S$$ as 

$$P_S(x) = \{c \mid \lVert c - x \rVert \text{ is minimal for } c \in S\}$$

In other words, $$P_S(x)$$ projects $$x$$ to the set of closest points in $$S$$.

In order to more easily define the Douglas-Rachford algorithm later, first define the reflection operator $$R_S$$ as

$$ R_S(x) = 2P_S(x) - x$$

Essentially, $$R_S(x)$$ "reflects" $$x$$ into the set $$S$$, for visual intuition, see this illustration by Matthew Tam.

### Assorted pedantry
Projection, and reflection is set valued. This is a fact I will **consciously ignore** over the rest of this article. Help participate in this doublethink with me, and if this topic ever confuses you, pretend that the projection operator also arbitrarily chooses an element from the set.

Additionally, the sets we're dealing with will be closed and nonempty, so projection is always defined. Please scream at me if I forget to include these in theorems.

## Example projection
While projecting on a set sounds like an even harder problem to solve than finding the intersection of sets, there are very many sets for which projection is known and easily calculated, like hyperplanes and hyperspheres. However, even for sets with a combinatorial flavour, projection can be surprisngly easy to compute.

### Projecting onto the set of permutations
Consider the set $$S \subseteq \reals^n$$ where $$c = (c_1, \dots, c_n) \in S$$ iff $$(c_1, \dots, c_n)$$ is a permutation of the integers 1 to $$N$$.

### Claim
$$P_S(x) = (b_1,\dots, b_n)$$ where $$b_i$$ is the new index of $$x_i$$ after sorting $$(x_1, \dots, x_n)$$ in ascending order. 

### Proof
We wish to find the $$c \in S$$ that minimises $$\lVert x - c \rVert$$, or equivalently we can minimise $$\lVert x - c \rVert^2$$. Expanding, we get

$$\lVert x - c \rVert^2 = \lVert x \rVert^2 - 2 x \cdot c + \lVert c \rVert^2$$

Observe that since $$c$$ is a permutation, all $$c \in S$$ have the same magnitude. Hence we wish to maximise $$ x \cdot c$$

Now we use the rearrangement inequality- which tells us to maximise the value of $$x \cdot c$$, we need to arrange the values of $$c$$ so that the smallest value of $$c$$ matches the smallest value of $$x$$, the second smallest of $$c$$ with second smallest of $$x$$, and so on.

### Implication
> $$P_S(x)$$ can be calculated in $$O(nlogn)$$ time. Wow.

In fact, many combinatorial sets tend to have the same idea of sorting, utilising a similar rearrangement inequality argument.

# Cyclic projections
How do we use our projections to solve feasibility problems? A very natural first idea would be to initialise some $$x_0$$ to some arbitrary point in $$E$$, then iteratively project to set 1, then set 2... then set $$n$$, and then cycle back around to set 1. Heuristically, it's like we are trying to  consider every single set in some systematic way.

This method has a long history and can be traced back to at least the work of **von Neumann** in 1950, where he proved convergence for $$n = 2$$ subspaces. Today, we know that so long as the sets are **convex**, then the algorithm will converge to the intersection when it exists.

### A more concise definition
Given $$n$$ constraint sets $$C_1, \dots, C_n$$, choose an arbitrary $$x_0 \in E$$, then define the following sequence

$$x_{k+1} = (P_{C_n}P_{C_{n-1}} \dots P_{C_1})(x_k)$$

> When the $$n$$ constraint sets are **convex** and the intersection is nonempty, then $$x_k$$ converges to an $$x \in C_1 \cap C_2 \cap \dots \cap C_n$$, no matter the starting point $$x_0$$.

# Douglas Rachford Algorithm
Another popular and well-studied algorithm is the Douglas-Rachford algorithm. This algorithm solves feasibility problems with 2 constraint sets, $$A,B \subseteq E$$

First, initialise $$x_0$$ to some arbitrary point in $$E$$. Then calculate the sequence using the following iteration step:

$$x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{2}x_k + \frac{1}{2}R_B R_A x_k$$ 

What an odd iteration step! I honestly still do not have a good visual intuition, and this specific operator still feels extremely arbitrary. However, it is what it is, and here are the following properties.

> When $$A$$ and $$B$$ are **convex** and $$A \cap B \neq \varnothing$$, then $$P_A(x_k)$$ will converge to a value $$x \in A \cap B$$, no matter the starting point $$x_0$$

## Comparing Douglas-Rachford with Cyclic Projections.
It's almost a disappointing result- it seems as if Douglas-Rachford does what cyclic projections do, but constrained to 2 sets. However, as it turns out, there is an additional fact about its that can be proven about this algorithm.

> Even when $$A$$ and $$B$$ are **non-convex**, if $$x_{k+1} = x_k$$, then $$P_A(x_k) \in A \cap B$$ 

In non-convex settings, cyclic projections does not have this property, and often gets stuck in fixed points that aren't the actual solution. This theorem tells us that Douglas-Rachford will not suffer from this problem. Of course, there are other ways Douglas-Rachford can fail to converge in non-convex settings. For example, it can get stuck in a cycle, or blow up to infinity. More concrete examples coming later in this article.


## Running this algorithm on n > 2 sets anyways
We can even do some nice trickery to get this algorithm to work on $$n$$ > 2 sets! Suppose we had $$n$$ sets $$C_1, \dots, C_n$$. Define new constraint sets $$\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D} \subseteq E^n$$ so that

$$\mathbf{C} = C_1 \times \dots \times C_n \text{ and } \mathbf{D} = \{(x,x,\dots,x) \mid x \in E\}$$

Clearly, if $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{C} \cap \mathbf{D}$$, then $$\mathbf{x}$$ will consist of $$N$$ identical copies of an $$x \in E$$, and will satisfy $$x \in C_i$$ for all $$i$$.

> If we have $$n$$ sets, then Douglas-Rachford can still solve the feasibility problem by running it on $$\mathbf{C}$$ and $$\mathbf{D}$$ as defined above.

For avoidance of doubt, from here on out, we shall notate $$\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2,\dots, x_r)$$

### Projections
Note that projections onto $$\mathbf{C}$$ and $$\mathbf{D}$$ can be quite easily calculated, we have

$$P_{\mathbf{C}}(\mathbf{x}) = P_{C_1}(x_1) \times \dots \times P_{C_n}(x_n)$$

$$P_{\mathbf{D}}(\mathbf{x}) = (\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \dots, \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)$$

# Malitsky-Tam Algorithm
My supervisor co-authored a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02897) proving a theoretical bound for the a class of algorithms- in the process constructing an algorithm that is capable of solving feasibility problems. However, its numerical performance isn't well studied, and he personally wanted to know how it would fare against combinatorial problems- and that's partly why I embarked on this project in particular.

A forewarning: We will now overload the power operator, and begin using superscripts as merely labels. Do not take $$x^k$$ to mean "$$x$$ to the power of $$k$$", but merely "$$x$$-$$k$$". 

Given $$n$$ closed, convex sets $$C_1 \times \dots \times C_n$$, initialise
