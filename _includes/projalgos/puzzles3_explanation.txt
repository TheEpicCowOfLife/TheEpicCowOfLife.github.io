Dynamic Cell Forcing Chains

With this solving technique, we will prove the following assertions:
    If F9 contains the value 3, then F3 cannot contain the value 5
    If F9 contains the value 5, then F3 cannot contain the value 5

Because the cell F9 cannot contain other values, and the results are the same, we can conclude that F3 cannot contain the value 5.

Each assertion is proved by a different chain of simple rules. The chains can be dynamic, which means that the conclusions of multiple sub-chains must be combined in some cases.

The details of each chain are given below. Use the view selector below the grid to switch between the graphical illustrations of the different chains.

Chain 1: If F9 contains the value 3, then F3 cannot contain the value 5 (View 1): (1) If F9 contains the value 3, then D9 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the block) (2) If D9 does not contain the value 3, then D4 must contain the value 3 (only remaining possible position in the column) (3) If D4 contains the value 3, then G4 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the row) (4) If G4 does not contain the value 3, then G4 must contain the value 2 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (5) If G4 contains the value 2, then H5 cannot contain the value 2 (the value can occur only once in the block) (6) If H5 does not contain the value 2, then A5 must contain the value 2 (only remaining possible position in the row) (7) If A5 contains the value 2, then A5 cannot contain the value 3 (the cell can contain only one value) (8) If D4 contains the value 3 (2), then A4 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the row) (9) If D4 contains the value 3 (2), then B4 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the row) (10) If B4 does not contain the value 3, A4 does not contain the value 3 (8) and A5 does not contain the value 3 (7), then A6 must contain the value 3 (only remaining possible position in the block) (11) If A6 contains the value 3, then G6 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the row) (12) If G4 does not contain the value 3 (3) and G6 does not contain the value 3, then G3 must contain the value 3 (only remaining possible position in the column) (13) If G3 contains the value 3, then I2 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the block) (14) If A6 contains the value 3 (10), then A2 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the column) (15) If G3 contains the value 3 (12), then H2 cannot contain the value 3 (the value can occur only once in the block) (16) If H2 does not contain the value 3, A2 does not contain the value 3 (14) and I2 does not contain the value 3 (13), then B2 must contain the value 3 (only remaining possible position in the row) (17) If B2 contains the value 3, then B2 cannot contain the value 5 (the cell can contain only one value) (18) If G4 contains the value 2 (4), then G1 cannot contain the value 2 (the value can occur only once in the column) (19) If G1 does not contain the value 2, then G1 must contain the value 5 (only remaining possible value in the cell) (20) If G1 contains the value 5, then B1 cannot contain the value 5 (the value can occur only once in the row) (21) If B1 does not contain the value 5 and B2 does not contain the value 5 (17), then B3 must contain the value 5 (only remaining possible position in the block) (22) If B3 contains the value 5, then F3 cannot contain the value 5 (the value can occur only once in the row)  Chain 2: If F9 contains the value 5, then F3 cannot contain the value 5 (View 2): (1) If F9 contains the value 5, then F3 cannot contain the value 5 (the value can occur only once in the column)
