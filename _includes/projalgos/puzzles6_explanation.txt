Dynamic Contradiction Forcing Chains

With this solving technique, we will prove the two following assertions:
    If H6 contains the value 1, then E1 must contain the value 4
    If H6 contains the value 1, then E1 cannot contain the value 4

Because the same assumption yields to contradictory results, we can conclude that the assumption is false, that is, H6 cannot contain the value 1.

Each assertion is proved by a different chain of simple rules. The chains can be dynamic, which means that the conclusions of multiple sub-chains must be combined in some cases.

The details of each chain are given below. Use the view selector below the grid to switch between the graphical illustrations of the two different chains.

Chain 1: If H6 contains the value 1, then E1 cannot contain the value 4 (View 1): (1) If H6 contains the value 1, then I6 cannot contain the value 1 (the value can occur only once in the block) (2) If
